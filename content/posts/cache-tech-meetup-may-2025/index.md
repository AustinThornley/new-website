### Event Details:
- **Date**: Saturday, May 24th, 2025
- **Time**: 1:30 PM – 3:30 PM (MST)
- **Location**: Bridgerland Technical College, West Building, Room 1860, 1410 N 1000 W, Logan, UT 84321

## Event Overview
Join us for an educational workshop on **Saturday, May 24th, 2025**, from **1:30 PM – 3:30 PM (MST)** at **Bridgerland Technical College**. This month, we're diving into the world of DNS (Domain Name System)! Our presenter will guide us through the ins and outs of DNS, including its vulnerabilities and security implications. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn about a critical part of the internet infrastructure that often goes unnoticed but impacts everything we do online.

## Why Learn About DNS?
DNS is often called the "phone book of the internet" - it's what translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Understanding DNS is crucial because:

- It's fundamental to how the entire internet works
- DNS vulnerabilities can lead to serious security breaches
- It's a key skill for networking professionals, system administrators, and security experts
- DNS configuration issues are among the most common causes of website outages
- Knowledge of DNS helps you protect your privacy and security online

## Detailed Event Schedule

Please check the bottom of the article to find a map to the location.

### Part 1: General Meetup & Networking (45 minutes)
- **1:30 - 1:45 PM**: Welcome, introductions, and community announcements
- **1:45 - 2:15 PM**: Open forum discussion on tech career paths
  - Educational journeys: comparing academic vs. self-taught experiences
  - Local tech job market insights and opportunities
  - Mentorship connections and resource sharing
- **2:15 - 2:30 PM**: Break and networking opportunity

### Part 2: DNS Deep Dive (60 minutes)


## Technical Details
During the workshop, we'll perform live demonstrations of DNS concepts and security practices. You'll learn (maybe) to:

1. **Understand DNS Infrastructure**
   - DNS resolution process step-by-step
   - Authoritative vs. recursive DNS servers
   - How caching works and its security implications
   - DNS propagation and TTL (Time To Live)

2. **Explore DNS Security Vulnerabilities**
   - DNS cache poisoning and spoofing attacks
   - DNS amplification and reflection DDoS attacks
   - DNS tunneling for data exfiltration
   - Zone transfer vulnerabilities
   - DNSSEC implementation issues

3. **Apply Security Best Practices**
   - Implementing DNSSEC for authentication
   - Using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT)
   - DNS filtering for threat protection
   - Split-horizon DNS for internal networks
   - Monitoring DNS traffic for suspicious activity

## Preparation Checklist
To get the most from this workshop, please prepare:

- **Required Software**:
  - A modern web browser
  - Basic terminal/command line tools
  - `dig`, `nslookup`, or similar DNS query tools
  - Wireshark (optional but helpful for packet analysis)

- **Optional but helpful**:
  - Basic understanding of networking concepts
  - Familiarity with IP addressing and subnets
  - Understanding of basic security principles
  - A laptop with administrative privileges (to modify DNS settings)
