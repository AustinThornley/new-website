### What is OSINT?
OSINT, or Open Source Intelligence, involves gathering information from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. It's a powerful tool used in cybersecurity, investigations, and research.

OSINT techniques can be incredibly useful for:
- Cybersecurity professionals looking to identify potential threats
- Journalists conducting research
- Researchers gathering data for studies
- Anyone interested in learning more about information gathering

### Ethics
It's important to note that OSINT should always be conducted ethically and legally. The techniques demonstrated will focus on using publicly available information without infringing on privacy or breaking any laws.

OSINT can be incredibly invasive if misused. Always ensure that your activities comply with legal standards and respect individual privacy. Targeting people without their consent is unethical and often can be illegal.

Participating in this event does not imply endorsement of any unethical or illegal activities. The goal is to educate and inform about the capabilities and applications of OSINT in a responsible manner.
