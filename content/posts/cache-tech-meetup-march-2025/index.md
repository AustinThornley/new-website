### Event Details:
- **Date**: Saturday, March 22nd, 2025
- **Time**: 1:30 PM – 3:30 PM (MST)
- **Location**: Bridgerland Technical College, West Building, Room 1860, 1410 N 1000 W, Logan, UT 84321

## Event Overview
Join us for an immersive security-focused programming workshop on **Saturday, March 22, 2025**, from **1:30 PM – 3:30 PM (MST)** at **Bridgerland Technical College**. This month, we're diving into the world of application security using Go (Golang), a powerful and increasingly popular programming language known for its performance, simplicity, and built-in concurrency features.

## Why Security in Go?
Go has become a preferred language for building modern infrastructure, microservices, and web applications. Its simplicity makes it an excellent choice for teaching security concepts, as the code remains readable while implementing sophisticated security patterns. By the end of this workshop, you'll understand how security vulnerabilities arise and how to protect against them using industry-standard techniques.

## Detailed Event Schedule

Please check the bottom of the article to find a map to the location.

### Part 1: General Meetup & Networking (45 minutes)
- **1:30 - 1:45 PM**: Welcome, introductions, and community announcements
- **1:45 - 2:15 PM**: Open forum discussion on tech career paths
  - Educational journeys: comparing academic vs. self-taught experiences
  - Local tech job market insights and opportunities
  - Mentorship connections and resource sharing
- **2:15 - 2:30 PM**: Break and networking opportunity

### Part 2: Technical Deep Dive (60 minutes)
- **2:30 - 2:45 PM**: Introduction to application security principles
  - The CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
  - Common vulnerabilities and attack vectors
  - Defensive programming mindset
- **2:45 - 3:15 PM**: Hands-on workshop: Securing a Chat Application
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - Implementing TLS for secure communications
  - Understanding Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
  - Protecting against common attacks (SQL injection, CSRF, XSS)
- **3:15 - 3:30 PM**: Q&A, advanced topics, and wrap-up

## Technical Details
During the workshop, we'll start with a basic, functional chat application written in Go and progressively enhance its security. You'll learn to:

1. **Implement secure user authentication**
   - Password hashing with salting using industry-standard algorithms
   - Secure password storage and verification
   - Session management best practices

2. **Secure network communications** (Maybe, depends if we have time.)
   - Setting up TLS certificates and secure connections
   - Implementing end-to-end encryption
   - Understanding cipher suites and their security implications

3. **Apply defense-in-depth strategies** (discussion topics)
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting and brute force protection
   - Secure coding practices specific to Go

## Preparation Checklist
To get the most from this workshop, please prepare:

- **Required Software**:
  - Go 1.18+ installed ([golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl))
  - Git ([git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
  - A terminal emulator
  - A code editor with Go support (VSCode with the Go extension recommended)

- **Optional but helpful**:
  - Basic understanding of HTTP/networking concepts
  - Familiarity with command-line interfaces
  - Docker installed (for optional deployment exercises)

## Community Engagement
The Cache Valley Tech Community is dedicated to fostering a supportive environment for technology enthusiasts of all levels. This event exemplifies our commitment to:
