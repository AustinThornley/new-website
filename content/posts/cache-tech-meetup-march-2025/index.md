We're continuing the format from last month! Here's what you can expect:

### Part 1: General Meetup (45 minutes)

We'll kick things off with an open discussion on navigating the tech world. Whether you’re pursuing formal education, self-learning, or growing through community-driven opportunities, we’d love to hear your story! This is your chance to share experiences, exchange ideas, and explore potential mentorship opportunities.

**All skill levels and ages are welcome—there's something for everyone!**

### Part 2: Technical Deep Dive (45 minutes)

In the second half, we'll teach you how to secure an application in Go! We'll cover the basics of password hashing, TLS, DH Key Exchanges and more!

**Key highlights include:**
- Programming in GO-Lang
- Securing an existing chat application
- Learning to hash passwords
- Learning to use TLS

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (beginners with no experience are welcome!)
- A laptop with Go installed (visit [golang.org](https://golang.org) to download Go)
- A terminal emulator (e.g., Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows, or any terminal emulator on Linux)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any editor of your choice)
- Curiosity and enthusiasm to learn!

**Additional Talking Points:**
- How can we translate what we've learned into the real world?
- Have you seen any code with some severe security holes?
- Why should software engineers learn these things?

### Who Should Attend?

This event is open to everyone—no exceptions! Whether you’re a beginner, self-taught, or an experienced tech professional, there’s something here for you.

Bring your curiosity, questions, and enthusiasm—let’s learn, connect, and grow together!
