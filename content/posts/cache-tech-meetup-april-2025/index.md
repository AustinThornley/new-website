## Event Overview
Join us for a hands-on self-hosting workshop on **Saturday, April 26, 2025**, from **1:30 PM – 3:30 PM (MST)** at **Bridgerland Technical College**. This month, we're diving into the world of self-hosted applications using Coolify, an open-source, self-hostable platform that simplifies the deployment and management of applications, databases, and services—giving you a fun sandbox to experiment with tech infrastructure.

## Why Self-Hosting with Coolify?
Self-hosting is a fantastic way to learn how systems actually work under the hood while building something useful. Coolify makes the process super approachable by handling the complex parts of deployment for you. It's like getting a backstage pass to how the internet works! By the end of this workshop, you'll have a playground to experiment with Docker, networking, and system administration - practical skills that look great on any tech resume.
